SETUP MODULE WITH NEW DEPLOYMENT

- composer require rurindut/oms-latihan:dev-master -vvv
- If you create new module and want it to be autoloaded as well, use your own branch. 
e.g. I pushed My new module on branch `xxxxx-12345678`, then I need to execute this one instead  `composer require rurindut/oms-latihan:dev-xxxxx-12345678`
